"""Unit tests — Marketplace entrypoint wiring.

Pins the seam the entry point exists for: `config/config.yaml` reaches the
agent, rather than the agent being constructed bare and the deployment running
on framework defaults without saying so.

The regression this file exists to catch is a *silent* one — an entry point that
still starts, still serves, and quietly ignores this template's configuration.
So the config assertions below pin the loaded values, not the type: asserting
`isinstance(config, dict)` would pass against a hard-coded `config={}`, which is
exactly the regression.
